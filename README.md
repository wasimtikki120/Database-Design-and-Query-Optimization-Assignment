# Financial Data Optimization Project

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing SQL queries for a large financial dataset. The dataset includes information about transactions, accounts, and categories. The goal is to enhance the performance of complex queries and suggest improvements to the database schema and indexing strategies.

## Files

- `LargeDataset.py`: Python script to generate a large dataset using the Faker library.
- `Complex.sql`: SQL script with the complex queries to be optimized.(1,2,3)
- `Optimized.sql`: SQL script with optimized solutions.(1,2,3,4,5)
- `readme.md`: Documentation file (this file).

## Instructions

1. **Generate Large Dataset:**
   - Run `LargeDataset.py` to create a large dataset named `transactions.csv`.
   - 
2. **Complex Queries Optimization:**
   - Execute `complex.sql` to test and optimize the complex SQL queries.
   - Queries have been optimized for performance based on the redesigned schema and indexing strategies.
  
3. **Queries Optimization:**
   - Execute `Optiized.sql` to test SQL queries.
